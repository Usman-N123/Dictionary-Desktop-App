# Dictionary-Desktop-App
Dictionary implemented using Tries Data Structures. Front End/GUI is made using CLR in Window Forms. C++ is used in CLR. The goal of the project is to use the Trie data structure to build a reliable dictionary management system. Trie was selected due to its effectiveness in word retrieval and storage. This makes it perfect for use in dictionaries.
